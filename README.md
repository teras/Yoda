# Yoda
Consult Yoda everytime you want to take serious desicions! A Magic 8-ball clone.

# Usage

I am wondering... why are you here?

This program is a decision maker. It means that every time you
have to take a really important decision (like whether should
order a pizza with mushrooms or not), you could ask the master
or masters and he will wisely guide you.

This program is an 8-ball clone. You can ask it questions and
expect to get answers like yes/no (or inbetween). This is a port
of a similar project written for the palm platform. When I sold
my palm, this was one of the programs I was missing - so I created
one!

As an added bonus, this program also has some jedi wisdom, if you
select this option.

Special thanks go to the people who originally had the concept of
this little game:
Pete Moss - bantha@bigfoot.com
Robert Hagenstroem - robert.hagenstrom@ebox.tninet.se


# Compile

The program is distributed already in binary (jar & jad) mode, ready
to be installed in any mobile device with new java implementation.

If you want to compile it, you will need at least WTK2.1. A preliminary
makefile is provided, but I don't know if this will work for you
(it works for me).
